# Geotutorial with Python basics

Miscellaneous Python scripts for a brief introduction to Python and some packages of interest
for geospatial computation. All packages and stuff are subjected to changes and possibly misbehavings, because of changes in
the packages used or web services depending on.

Even, the whole bounce of scripts were born with Python 2.x and ported to 3.x series, lately.

Use at your own risks.
